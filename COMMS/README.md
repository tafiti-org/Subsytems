## Work Still to be done
- Adding PC104 Connectors and assigned pins from main bus.
- Adding 3D models of the sx1278 Ra-02.
- Adding Logo, Subsytem name, members and more information
- Verify accuracy and requirements fulfilment
- Confirm that the PCB meets the EMC and EMI standards and that it is well designed.

(The above tasks should be done and marked as done beside the task)

## Purpose

To provide a communication channel to transfer data to and from the Tafiti Nano-satellite.
The data to be transferred includes:
- Image data
- Housekeeping data
- Commands

## Requirements
- Receive housekeeping data from the OBC. This data will effectively be a collection of data from all other subsystems.
- Receive payload data from the Payload subsystem.
- Provide a communication link for the transfer of housekeeping data and payload data from the Cubesat to the 
ground terminal. 
- Provide a link to send telecommands from the ground to the cubesat. This will be a bi-directional communication.
- Provide an interface to view received data and key in commands.
- Allow for data storage onboard the cubesat and on the ground station.
- Provide an API to transfer data over Web.
- Should be portable.
- Data transfer rates should be fast.
- Long range.
